In this option, you can run a script that automates the installation process and provides prompts for necessary information. It simplifies the setup and configuration of your validator node.

To use the scripted installation option, follow the instructions provided in the [Scripted Installation](scripted-installation.md) page.

## Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer more control over the installation process and want to configure each step manually, you can choose the manual installation option. This option involves tasks such as upgrading your server, installing packages, and setting up the validator node.

Refer to the [Manual Installation](manual-installation.md) page for detailed instructions on how to perform the manual installation process.

Choose the option that suits your requirements and proceed with the respective guide to run your substrate validator node.

**Note:** It's recommended to have basic knowledge of server administration and networking concepts for both installation options.
