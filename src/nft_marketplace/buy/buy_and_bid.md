4. If an NFT is up for sale (not for auction), you can immediately buy it by choosing **"Buy NFT"**.

5. If you win an auction, you can claim it by going back to **"account"** and selecting the downward arrow on the far right of the collection that you were bidding on. Then select the 'pencil symbol" on the right and select **"claim"**.
