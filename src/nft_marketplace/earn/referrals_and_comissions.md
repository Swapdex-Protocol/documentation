# Our Referral And Commission System

## Seller

### Setting Your Commission

- If you want to incentivize referrals by giving a commission to someone for selling your NFT, you can do this by setting the **“Add Share For Referrals (%)”** when selling your NFT.

## Referrer

### Setting Up Your Referral Wallet

1. Expand the SwapDEX NFT marketplace, on the left side menu of the SwapDEX Dashboard App and select **“Referrals”**.

2. Choose the wallet you want to register for referrals and select **“register for referrals”**.

3. Choose the percentage you would like to give as a cashback to your buyer as an incentive.

   - Note: The percentage you set is basically a discount of what the seller is giving to you as the referrer to your customers. So, if a seller has a 20% referral percentage, you would set your wallet's referral percentage at 50% to split the commission and give 10% off as cashback when the buyer purchases an NFT through your link.

### Advertising Your Referred NFT
